<h4 class="subtitle">Lupo: his story</h4>
  <p>Lupo was found wondering around a construction site. The town rescue center was informed but sadly, they were full and couldn't take him in. They shared <a href="https://es.paperblog.com/lupo-en-la-calle-casa-de-acogida-o-adopcion-murcia-1356342/"> an urgent plea</a> to find a foster home. He was in a dangerous place, close to a high-kill shelter and the people in the area weren't fond of his presence.<br></br>
    The following video was his first appearance in our lives:<br></br>

</div>
  <p>We couldn't resist it, we had to take him in as soon as we watched that video. At first, he came home as a foster, but soon we knew he belonged to our family.

  <h4 class="subtitle">Some of Lupo through time </h4>
  <p> Lupo's personality evolved from the shy guy you see on the video, to an outgoing and playful rascal. These are some of his <i>unique</i> traits:
    <ul>
      <li>Loves chasing tennis balls</li>
       <li>He is crazy about squeezy toys</li>
       <li>Enjoys car drives</li>
       <li>He is afraid of bigger dogs</li>
       <li>He barks a lot if someone rings our home bell</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Well, he is a dog after all!<p>
  
  <p> And now, here you are som pictures of Lupo and Lemon -first foster, now ours- and two foster dogs that we had: </p>
